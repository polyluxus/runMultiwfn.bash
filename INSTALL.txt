INSTALLATION GUIDE

This is the most important part, because without the 
correct installation it will not work.
I have tried to simplify it as much as possible and I will be
working on it further, but until then see the following.

(.) The script

  You probably have obtained the script already, have read the 
  readme file and are ready to modify it to your system. 
  Below are some recommendations about how I have installed it.

(a) Variables

  The script will attempt to read variables necessary for
  the execution of MultiWFN from the environment settings.
  The reason for that was so that the script could be called 
  by another script which submits it to a scheduler, and the 
  execution is then carried out on via the compute nodes.
  However, I have abandonned this idea. 
  It is possible to write a submission script, which implements
  this functionality here.

  I am currently unsure (version > 0.5.0 of this script)
  what happens if such variables are set, 
  I need to test this again. (But I have no time.)

  If variables are unset, they will be replaced by default 
  values or they can be specified via the option switches,
  or the rc file.

  If you followed the instructions in the Multiwfn manual 
  then you might have already set the environment variables
  KMP_STACKSIZE, and Multiwfnpath. 
  In older versions you had to make additions to
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH, too.
  You might even have added a directory to PATH.
  This needs to be undone in order to use this script
  without problems.
  If you have added any of the following lines to your 
  bashrc, then they need to be removed. We assume for a
  moment, that we unpacked the program to the path
  ~/sob/Multiwfn, so the bashrc probably contains these
  lines:
    export KMP_STACKSIZE=64000000
    export Multiwfnpath=~/sob/Multiwfn
  And in older versions also
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:~/sob/Multiwfn
  Delete them. Otherwise the script will always read 
  these values and use them. Then there is no point in 
  using this script in the first place.
  (Again, I am not sure anymore what actually happens,
  but it is safe to delete those lines.)

  If the script finds executable commands 'Multiwfn', or
  'multiwfn', it will abort, make sure nothing is sourced 
  at that time.

(b) Unpacking

  I personally like to have a seperate user for any
  chemistry related software. This is not necessary. But
  it keeps the pathnames a little shorter. On my system
  the user is called "chemsoft". This is the home:
    /home/chemsoft/
  (This is unfortunately not true anymore.)

  You can also easily install it to a directory in your
  home, or sowftware collection.
  I currently use 
    $HOME/local/multiwfn/multiwfn.current
  or alternatively the project directory on CLAIX18, like
    /home/rwth0425/local/multiwfn/multiwfn-3.6

  You can uncompress the original script to any location
  that suits you. I simply clone the git repository into
    $HOME/local/multiwfn/runMultiwfn.bash
  or alternatively
    /home/rwth0425/local/runMultiwfn.bash

  Version 0.5.0 (and later) comes with an example `settings.ini`,
  which you should modify to suit your needs and copy 
  to the same directory as `runMultiwfn.sh`.

  The only line you should leave untouched is the one like
    nthreads= <digit(s)> //How many threads [...]
  because that will be modified by the script.
  (It wouldn't have an effect if you'd modify it.)

  You should then modify the `runMultiwfn.rc` file, or
  create `.runMultiwfnrc` (takes precedence if found),
  and set the following two lines:
    installpath_Multiwfn_gui="$HOME/local/multiwfn/multiwfn.current"
    installpath_Multiwfn_nogui="" # Disabled if empty

  The default search chain for rc files is
    (1) the installation directory
    (2) the user's home directory
    (3) the parent work directory
  and it will use the values from the last one found.
  All settings (except the binaries) can be changed with switches.

(c) Non-GUI versions

  If you want to use the version without the GUI (and maybe want to
  switch) you have to specify another version, i.e.
    installpath_Multiwfn_nogui="$HOME/local/multiwfn/multiwfn_nogui.current"

(d) Modifying the script

  If you use the rc settings, you do not have to modify the script.
  However, if you prefer, you can hardcode the paths into the script, too.

(e) What else?

  If you want to access the manual with the -H switch, you need to download 
  it and put it with the executable. The script searches for a pdf file,
  and will display the first it finds.

  There are a couple of options implemented to look for a pdf viewer,
  the safest is to set 'use_pdfviewer=' to your preferred one in the rc.
  Tested are in that order: "use_pdfviewer" xdg-open gvfs-open evince okular less.

  Also please make sure the script is executeable.
    (chmod +x <scriptname>)
  Occasionally the Multiwfn distribution itself was not marked executable;
  therefore better check that one, too.

  Now everything should be done.

(f) Optional

  You can create a softlink link in your personal ~/bin 
  directory for easier access. This is of course provided 
  that your ~/bin is part of $PATH.
  The script finds its directory even through multiple links.
  Alternatively you can add an alias, or add the multiwfn
  directory to your PATH.
  Do not use the commands 'Multiwfn' or 'multiwfn', as the script will
  abort whenever it finds out that these commands exist, even if it is itself.
